**Subject: Reduce Hiring Fraud Risk While Cutting Recruitment Costs**

---

Dear [CHRO Name],

I'm reaching out because your organization likely faces a challenge that's costing companies billions annually: **unverified candidates wasting your team's time and budget.**

Studies show that up to 78% of resumes contain misleading information. Your HR team spends countless hours screening candidates who misrepresent their qualifications—time that could be spent on strategic initiatives.

## Introducing Real Jobs, Real People

We've built a job board with a fundamentally different approach: **every candidate is verified before they can apply.**

### How It Works

Before job seekers can submit a single application, they must verify:
- Phone number (SMS verification)
- Email address (link verification)
- LinkedIn profile (optional enhanced verification)

This simple barrier eliminates the spam applications, fake profiles, and unserious candidates that plague traditional job boards.

### Why This Matters to You

| Traditional Job Boards | Real Jobs, Real People |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| 200+ applications per posting | Fewer, qualified applications |
| Hours screening out fakes | Pre-verified candidates only |
| No accountability | Full verification trail |
| Pay for spam | Pay for quality |

### The Business Case

For a typical mid-size company:
- **Reduce time-to-hire** by eliminating unqualified applicant screening
- **Lower cost-per-hire** with higher quality applicant pools
- **Decrease ghosting rates** with verified, committed candidates
- **Mitigate fraud risk** before it reaches your team
