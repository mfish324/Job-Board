>
> There are three verification levels:
> - **Basic** - just verify your email
> - **Enhanced** - add phone verification for an extra trust badge
> - **Complete** - verify your company information for maximum credibility
>
> Most employers complete Basic verification in under a minute. Just check your email, click the verification link, and you're ready to post.
>
> The verification badge appears on all your job listings, showing candidates they can trust your posting."

*[Visual: Screen recording - Post Job form]*

>
> Add your company name and location. For remote positions, you can specify that in the Remote Status field.
>
> Here's a tip that gets you better candidates: **include the salary or salary range**. Jobs with salary information get significantly more qualified applicants.
>
> Select the job type - full-time, part-time, contract, and so on. Choose the experience level you're looking for.
>
> Now write your job description. Focus on what the person will actually do day-to-day, not just a list of requirements. Be specific about must-haves versus nice-to-haves.
