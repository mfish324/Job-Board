                    <p class="mb-3">
                        Real Jobs, Real People was born from a simple observation: the job market is broken.
                        Ghost jobs that were never meant to be filled. Applicants who pour their hearts into
                        applications only to be ghosted by recruiters. A system that treats job seekers as
                        data points rather than human beings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        We've experienced it ourselves. We've watched friends and family go through the
                        demoralizing cycle of applying, hoping, and hearing nothing back. The frustration.
                        The self-doubt. The despair.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        We believe deeply in the dignity of work. Each of us has an inherent desire to
                        contribute to our communities, to use our skills and talents to make a difference.
                        A job isn't just a paycheck&mdash;it's purpose, identity, and connection. The current
                        job search system undermines all of that, and we decided to do something about it.

                        but as community members looking for the right people to help them succeed. Our job is
                        simply to help them find each other.
