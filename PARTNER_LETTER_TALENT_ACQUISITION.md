# Partner Recruitment Letter - Directors of Talent Acquisition

---

**Subject: What If Every Applicant Was Real and Reachable?**

---

Dear [Director Name],

Let me guess your Monday morning:

You open your ATS to find 347 new applications for that Software Engineer role. By Friday, you'll discover that 40% are spam, 25% are wildly unqualified, and half the "qualified" candidates ghost your outreach.

**What if that changed tomorrow?**

## Real Jobs, Real People: Verified Candidates Only

We built a job board that solves the problem you deal with every single day: **candidates who aren't who they claim to be—or aren't serious about the role.**

### Every Candidate Must Verify Before Applying

- **Phone Verification** - SMS code confirms a real, reachable person
- **Email Verification** - Validated inbox, not a throwaway
- **LinkedIn Integration** - Optional enhanced verification shows professional legitimacy

No verification = No application button. Period.

### What This Means for Your Pipeline

**Before (Traditional Boards):**
```
500 applications
  → 200 spam/fake (40%)
  → 150 unqualified (30%)
  → 100 maybe qualified (20%)
  → 50 worth screening (10%)
  → 25 respond to outreach (5%)
```

**After (Real Jobs, Real People):**
```
75 applications
  → 0 spam/fake (0%)
  → 60 qualified (80%)
  → 45 respond to outreach (60%)
```

**Same role. Better candidates. Faster fills.**

## Built for TA Teams, Not Just HR

We understand that Talent Acquisition has different needs than general HR:

### Features That Matter to You

- **Pipeline Visualization** - Kanban-style candidate tracking
- **Bulk Actions** - Move, tag, or message multiple candidates
- **Team Collaboration** - Assign reviewers, share notes, track who did what
- **Custom Stages** - Match your existing workflow, not ours
- **Response Templates** - Consistent candidate communication at scale
- **Source Tracking** - Know which channels deliver verified talent

### Integrations Coming Soon

- ATS webhooks (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday)
- Calendar scheduling (Calendly, Google, Outlook)
- Background check partners
- Assessment platforms
