# Real Jobs, Real People (RJRP)
## Partner Recruitment Document

**Platform:** https://rjrp.onrender.com
**Date:** November 2025
**Status:** Proof of Concept → Market Launch

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:** The $30B job board market is broken. Major platforms like Indeed and LinkedIn have prioritized scale over quality, creating a marketplace flooded with spam, fake jobs, and frustrated users on both sides. Meanwhile, premium vetting platforms like Toptal and Hired charge $15,000-$20,000 per hire, making them inaccessible to small businesses.

**The Gap:** There is no free job board that vets both employers and candidates.

**Our Solution:** RJRP is building the first dual-vetting job marketplace that's completely free. We combine the quality of premium platforms like Toptal with the accessibility of Indeed, creating a unique value proposition in a $40B+ growing market.

**What We're Looking For:** Strategic partners who can help us scale from proof of concept to market leader. We need expertise in recruitment, marketing, technology, and go-to-market strategy.

## The Problem We're Solving

### For Job Seekers:

**Application Black Hole**
98% of applications on Indeed/LinkedIn receive no response. Job seekers apply to hundreds of positions with zero feedback or transparency.

**Spam and Fake Jobs**
30-40% of job listings aren't real positions. Companies "post and park" jobs to build pipelines. Scammers post fake remote positions. Old jobs stay live for months.

**Information Overload**
A search for "Marketing Manager" on Indeed returns 10,000+ results. The sheer volume makes it impossible to identify quality opportunities.

**Impersonal Experience**
Automated rejection systems, no direct employer contact, and ATS keyword filters create a dehumanizing experience.

### For Employers:

**Application Overload**
100-500 applications per job on Indeed/LinkedIn, with 90% unqualified due to "Easy Apply" spam. Finding quality candidates is like finding a needle in a haystack.

**High Costs**
LinkedIn charges $499-$999/month. ZipRecruiter charges $249-$449/month. Toptal charges $60-$200/hour. Small businesses can't afford quality hiring tools.

**Low-Quality Applicants**
Spray-and-pray applicants, resume collectors, and bots flood the system. Employers waste hours screening unqualified candidates.

**Lack of Control**
Once posted, jobs are hard to edit, deactivate, or manage. Poor candidate communication tools hurt employer brands.

**LinkedIn** (#1 Professional Network)

## Why RJRP Will Win

**The job board market is broken. Everyone knows it.**

Employers waste thousands on low-quality applicants. Job seekers waste hundreds of hours in black holes. The incumbents have no incentive to fix it because their revenue depends on volume, not quality.

**Premium vetting platforms prove that quality matters.** Toptal charges 10x market rate. Hired charges $20k per hire. FlexJobs has been profitable for 18 years. But these platforms are inaccessible to 99% of employers and many job seekers.

**RJRP is building the platform the market needs:**
- Quality of Toptal, accessibility of Indeed
- Transparency no one else offers
- Free for everyone, premium when you need it
- Both sides vetted, both sides valued

**We don't need to beat Indeed on scale.** We just need to capture 0.1% of their market (25,000 users) to build a thriving business.

**The market is ready. The technology exists. The opportunity is now.**

**The question is: Will you join us?**
