## A Note to Recruiters

You know the hiring landscape better than anyone. You've seen the Indeed inbox explode with 500 unqualified applications. You've watched clients burn through recruiting budgets on platforms that deliver quantity over quality. You've counseled candidates who've sent 200 applications into the void without a single response.

**The system is broken, and you're stuck in the middle trying to make it work.**

RJRP was built to fix this. We're launching a dual-vetting job marketplace that filters out the noise so you can focus on what you do best: matching great candidates with great opportunities.

**We're looking for 5-10 founding recruiter partners to help us launch - and we're making it worth your while.**

## The Opportunity

### What's Wrong with Current Platforms

**For Your Candidates:**
- 98% of applications on Indeed/LinkedIn get zero response
- 30-40% of postings are ghost jobs or scams
- ATS keyword filters reject qualified people
- No transparency on application status

**For Your Clients:**
- 100-500 applications per posting, 90% unqualified
- LinkedIn costs $499-$999/month
- Hours wasted screening spray-and-pray applicants
- Good candidates lost in the noise

**For You:**
- Fighting the same broken tools everyone else uses
- Competing on the same overcrowded platforms
- Spending more time filtering than recruiting

### What RJRP Does Differently

**Dual-Vetting = Better Signal-to-Noise**
- Employers verified: phone + email + legitimacy check
- Candidates verified: email + resume required + profile standards
- Result: 95%+ spam-free marketplace

**Real-Time Transparency**
- Candidates see: Pending → Reviewed → Accepted/Rejected
- No more "did they even see my application?"
- One-click status updates for employers

**Clean, Professional Experience**
- Modern interface (not 1990s Craigslist)
- Mobile-responsive
- Fast, ad-free, no pop-ups

## Launch Strategy: The First 25

### Free Founding Employer Program

To build initial momentum, we're offering **free lifetime Basic tier access** to the first 25 employers who sign up through our founding recruiter partners.

**What This Means:**
- First 25 employers get Basic tier ($49/month value) **free forever**
- They keep all features even after we start charging new users
- Creates immediate platform activity and job listings
- Gives you real opportunities to place candidates

**Why We're Doing This:**
- Job boards have a chicken-and-egg problem: need jobs to attract candidates, need candidates to attract employers
- 25 engaged employers = 50-125 active job postings at launch
- Creates word-of-mouth from grateful early adopters
- Demonstrates value before asking for payment

## Why This Works for Recruiters

### You Get a Competitive Edge

- Transparency features improve candidate experience
- Professional interface reflects well on you

**Free Tools = More Margin**
- No per-posting fees eating into your commission
- Unlimited job postings on Pro tier
- Resume database included (competitors charge extra)

**Early Mover Advantage**
- Established on platform before it grows
- Relationship with founding team
- Revenue share locked in at favorable terms

### The Market Opportunity

**Job Board Market:** $29.7B (2024) → $40B+ (2030)

**Premium Vetting Proven:**
- Toptal (vetted freelancers): $1B+ valuation
- Hired (vetted tech talent): Sold for $100M+
- FlexJobs (curated jobs): Profitable 18+ years

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why should I trust a new platform?**
A: We're not asking you to abandon your current tools. Use RJRP alongside what you already do. As a founding partner, you'll have direct access to the team and can shape the platform's direction.

**Q: What if it doesn't take off?**
A: You've invested a few hours posting jobs you were already filling. Even if RJRP grows slowly, you have free access to a quality platform. There's no downside.

**Q: How do you make money if founding employers are free?**
A: The first 25 are loss leaders to solve the cold-start problem. Every employer after that pays. Your revenue share kicks in when your referrals convert to paid tiers.

**Q: What's the long-term vision?**
A: Become the go-to platform for quality hiring. Not the biggest job board - the best one. The one recruiters recommend because it actually works.

**Q: Who else is involved?**
A: We're assembling a small team of founding recruiter partners. You'd be joining 5-10 others who see the same opportunity.

**As a founding partner, you get:**
- Free Pro tier access (forever)
- 15% revenue share on referrals
- Direct product input
- First-mover advantage on a growing platform

**We need:**
- 5-10 hours/month for 3 months

**We think it will succeed. Let's find out together.**
